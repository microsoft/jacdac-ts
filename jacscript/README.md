# JacScript

## Design goals for Jacscript VM

* secure - can predictably execute untrusted code (random bytes)
* easy to analyze - should be possible to statically determine the set of APIs used
* small memory (RAM) footprint
* small code (flash) footprint
* leave space for extensions in future

## JavaScript subset

Global and local variables are supported (only `var`, no `const` or `let`).

All variables are numbers (64-bit IEEE floating point).
Numeric binary and unary expressions are supported.
Comparisons return `0.0` or `1.0` (in particular comparing anything to `NaN` returns `0.0`).
`0.0` and `NaN` are considered falsy.
TODO should compare with NaN return NaN?

```js
var x, y
x = pot.reading.read()
if (x < 0.3) {
    y = x * 3
} else {
    y = -x / 7
}
```

Some builtin functions only take literal arguments (especially strings, and time values).

The only jump statement supported is currently `return`. There are no loops.

## Logging and format strings

The `print()` function takes a literal string, and optionally format arguments.

```js
print("Hello world")
print("X is {0} and Y is {1}", x, y)
```

Arguments are `{0}`, `{1}`, ..., `{9}`, `{A}`, `{B}`, ..., `{F}`.
A second digit can be supplied to specify precision (though this doesn't work so well yet):

```js
print("X = {04}", x)
```

Some functions that take string literals also accept `format()` function, using the same formatting strings as `print()`,
for example:

```js
charDisplay.message.write(format("X is {0}", x))
```

## Roles

Roles are defined by referencing a service name (in `roles` namespace).
The same role can be referenced multiple times, and runtime makes sure not to assign
multiple roles to the same service instance.

```js
var btnA = roles.button()
var btnB = roles.button()
var pot = roles.potentiometer()
var lamp = roles.lightBulb()
```

You can check if role is currently assigned, and react to it being assigned or unassigned:

```js
if (heater.isConnected())
    heater.active.write(1)
heater.onConnected(() => {
    // ...
})
heater.onDisconnected(() => {
    // ...
})
```

## Events

Events are referenced as `myRole.eventName`. They currently have two member functions, `.wait()` and `.sub()`.

```js
btnA.down.sub(() => {
    print("button down!")
})

// ...
btnA.up.wait()
// ...
```

## Handlers and Fibers

While handler registration (for events, register changes, device connect, etc.)
looks dynamic, it is implemented statically.
Thus handlers can be only registered at the top-level and un-conditionally.

Every handler runs in its own fiber (lightweight thread).
The scheduler is non-preemptive, meaning
a fiber executes without interruption until it returns or hits an asynchronous operation,
upon which point it's suspended.
Example async operations are `wait()` and register read.
Only one fiber executes at a time, while the other fibers are suspended.
This is similar to modern JavaScript, but there's no `await` keyword.

When the executor is woken up (typically due to an incoming packet or a timer expiring),
it will execute all viable fibers until they become suspended.
Executing a fiber may start another viable fiber, which would be also executed until suspension,
before any more packets are processed.

### Handler-pending model

At any given time, there is at most one fiber (which could be suspended) executing a given handler.
If this is not desired, `bg(() => { ... })` syntax can be used to queue code execution
in background, without limits of how many instances of it are running (TODO not impl yet).
If a handler is triggered again, while it is still executing, a boolean flag is set on it,
so that it starts again (once) after the current execution finishes.

## Registers

Registers are referenced as `myRole.regName`, where `regName` can also be the system-wide name,
so both `pot.position` and `pot.reading` will work.
TODO should we drop this, and only leave `pot.position` ?

Registers have following methods - `.onChange()`, `.read()` and `.write()`.
If register contains multiple fields, a tuple (array) is returned.

```js
var x
x = pot.position.read()
x = pot.reading.read() // equivalent

lamp.brightness.write(0.7)

var r, g, b
[r, g, b] = colorSensor.color.read()

myLed.color.write(0.3, 1, 0.7)
```

The `.onChange()` handler can be registered to execute whenever the value of the register changes
by at least the specified value.
It is executed once when the value is first determined, and then whenever the current value
is different by at least the specified value from the value at previous handler execution.

```js
pot.position.onChange(0.02, () => {
    lamp.brightness.write(pot.position.read())
})
```

## Top-level functions

### Time

Run a function periodically (`0.3s` in the example below; `20ms` minimum):
```js
every(0.3, () => {
    // ...
})
```

Wait given number of seconds:
```js
wait(0.3)
```

### Cloud telemetry upload

Send a label + 0 or more numeric values.

```js
upload("potval", pot.reading.read())
upload("color", r * 256, g * 256, b * 256)
upload(format("X[{0}]", idx), x)
```

### Math

Arithmetic operators are supported: `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `**`, as well as unary `-` and `+`.

Comparison operators `<`, `<=`, `>`, `>=`, `==`, `===`, `!=`, `!==` are supported (and return doubles).

The operators `&&` and `||` are supported, but are **currently not lazy**.
The boolean negation `!` is supported (returning `0` or `1`).

The bitwise operators are not supported.

The following math functions and constants are supported:
* `Math.floor`
* `Math.round`
* `Math.ceil`
* `Math.log`
* `Math.random`
* `Math.max`
* `Math.min`
* `Math.pow`
* `Math.sqrt`
* `Math.cbrt`
* `Math.exp`
* `Math.log10`
* `Math.log2`
* `Math.E`
* `Math.PI`
* `Math.LN10`
* `Math.LN2`
* `Math.LOG2E`
* `Math.LOG10E`
* `Math.SQRT1_2`
* `Math.SQRT2`
* `isNaN`
* `NaN`

### Misc functions

The `panic()` function takes a numeric error code and terminates or restarts the program.
`reboot()` is similar, but doesn't print error message.

```js
panic(348)
reboot()
```

### User-defined functions

User-defined functions are allowed at the top-level, using `function foo(x, y) { ... }` syntax.
They are also allowed as event handlers using arrow syntax (see above).
Nested functions and real first-class functions are not supported.

Functions can return values.
A plain `return` is equivalent to `return NaN`.

## Random notes

### Memory usage analysis

Main dynamic memory usage - function activation records (and fibers).
* `BG_MAX1` call frames can be only allocated once
* whatever they call may need additional frames
* can collect all register gets and estimate memory for them (do we need a size limit on these?)


## TODO

* add opcode to cache current packet (in onChanged())
* is timeout in yield needed?
* extend format strings to include numfmt
* `memcmp()` opcode
* shift buffer opcode?
* implement `QUERY_IDX_REG`
* somehow deal with events with legit args (button and barcode reader currently) - doesn't work so well in handler-pending model
* add `role.waitConnected()` or something?
* add `bg(() => { ... })`, also `bg1()` ?
* do fiber round-robin for yields?
* role mgr interface and storage
* some testing framework? (depends on services?)

### Implementing services in jacscript

* this generally doesn't work with handler-pending model
* opcode to send current packet
* opcode to set the command
* opcode to set service number
* some way of building announce packets
* handler when a packet is received
* support 1 or more devices per VM instance?
* add `try_again` report in addition to `command_not_implemented` ?

### Cloud

* responding to cloud messages: `onCloud("play_sound", (freq, time) => { ... })`
* responding to twin updates: `onTwinUpdate("foo.bar", value => { ... })`; on boot as well
* specific uploads: `hum.autoUpload(5, 1) // 5s, 1%`
* auto-upload of everything

### Debugger interface

* fiber list, locals, globals
* setting breakpoints - breakpoint instruction? (based on source code location)
* more "debug" info in compiled program - role names, etc for error messages?
