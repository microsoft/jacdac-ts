# Jacdac TypeScript and Documentation

**Jacdac** is a bus-based plug-and-play hardware/software stack 
for **microcontrollers** and their peripherals (sensors/actuators), 
with applications to rapid prototyping, making, and physical computing. 

This repository contains a TypeScript/JavaScript client library for the [Jacdac](https://aka.ms/jacdac) protocol.

* [User Documentation](https://aka.ms/jacdac/)
* Discussions at https://github.com/microsoft/jacdac/discussions
* Issues are tracked on https://github.com/microsoft/jacdac/issues

The rest of this page is for developers of the jacdac-ts library.

### Build

To have a watch developement,

```
yarn watch
```

otherwise

```
yarn dist
```

### Specs build

To regenerate the service definition JSON files from the ``.md`` files in jacdac-spec,
run

```
yarn buildspecs
```

## Unit tests

We use [Mocha](https://mochajs.org/) to run the unit test suite from ``/tests``. To execute the tests,

```
yarn test
```

## Linting

Run the following command to detect linting issues

```
yarn lint
```

### Jacdac + MakeCode

### Local build

Run this command to rebuild the makecode packages

```
yarn buildpxt
```

### HTML Tools

Launch a small web server and 
try all the tools under ``docs/static/tools/*`` at http://localhost:8080/docs/static/tools/js/console.html . These tools load the files under ``dist`` so you'll want 
to also run ``npm run watch`` on the side.

```
yarn tools
```

* console http://localhost:8080/tools/js/console.html
* devices http://localhost:8080/tools/js/devices.html
* flashing http://localhost:8080/tools/js/flashing.html
* namer http://localhost:8080/tools/js/namer.html
* tfite http://localhost:8080/tools/js/tflite.html
* streaming http://localhost:8080/tools/js/streaming.html
* streaming-rickshaw: http://localhost:8080/tools/js/streaming-rickshaw.html

### Commits create releases

The releases are automatically created by the build system based on the title of the commit:

* ``patch:...`` or ``fix:...``  patch
* ``minor:...`` or ``feature:...`` minor
