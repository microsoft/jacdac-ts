# Jacdac TypeScript

**Jacdac** is a bus-based plug-and-play hardware/software stack 
for **microcontrollers** and their peripherals (sensors/actuators), 
with applications to rapid prototyping, making, and physical computing. 

This repository contains a **TypeScript/JavaScript** client library for the [Jacdac](https://aka.ms/jacdac) protocol.

```

otherwise to build all libraries

```
yarn dist

### Specs build

To regenerate the service definition JSON files from the ``.md`` files in jacdac-spec,

```
yarn buildspecs
```

## Unit tests

We use [Mocha](https://mochajs.org/) to run the unit test suite from ``/tests``. To execute the tests,

```
yarn test

### Jacdac + MakeCode

### Local build

Run this command to rebuild the makecode packages

```
yarn buildpxt
```

### HTML Tools

Launch a small web server and 
try all the tools under ``/tools/*`` at [http://localhost:8080/tools](http://localhost:8080/tools) . These tools load the files under ``dist`` so you'll want 
to also run ``yarn watch`` on the side.

```
yarn tools
```
