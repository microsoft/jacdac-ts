# Jacdac - USB for low-cost microcontrollers

**Jacdac** is a plug-and-play hardware/software stack 
for **microcontrollers** and their peripherals (sensors/actuators), 
with applications to rapid prototyping, making, and physical computing. 

* novel 3-wire cable and connector
* bus topology
* device discovery and service advertisement
* standardized service abstraction
* full stack from 8bit MCU to web development

## Services specifications

Jacdac services are specified to abstract the hardware device from the software implementation.
The services are comprised of registers, commands and events, along with precise data layout information
for each packet.

* Browse the [service catalog](/services)
* Learn more about [service specifications](/reference/specification/service-specification)

## Device catalog & Firmware Updates

The device catalog lists the registered Jacdac devices that can be automatically detected on the bus. 
The catalog information provides vendor information, the services supported by a device, 
firmware, and pictures. This information is also used to automtically detect, download and flash
firmware onto devices.

* Learn more about [device definitions](/reference/specification/device-definition)


## Protocol overview

Jacdac devices communicate using *packets* over a *bus*, where each *device* can advertise itself 
and the set of *services* it provides. 
A *service* provides *registers*, *events* and *commands* to communicate with other devices.
Jacdac packets are sent serially among physical devices on the Jacdac bus
and may also be sent over WebUSB/WebBLE, 
providing connectivity to web-based tooling and services running in the web browser
(see the connect icon at the top of this page).
