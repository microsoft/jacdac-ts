**JACDAC** (**J**oint **A**synchronous **C**ommunications; **D**evice **A**gnostic **C**ontrol) is a
a plug-and-play hardware/software stack for connecting microcontrollers and their peripherals 
(sensors/actuators), with applications to rapid prototyping, making, and physical computing. 

JACDAC devices communicate over a *bus*, where each *device* can advertise itself and the set of device-specific services it provides via the JACDAC control service, common to all devices. A *service* is specified by a *service class* that encapsulates the process of communicating with a JACDAC device via packets. A *packet* includes a device identifier and data payload. JACDAC packets are sent serially among physical devices on the JACDAC bus and may also be sent over WebUSB, providing connectivity to web-based tooling and services running in the web browser (see the connect icon at the top of this page). 

## Device catalog

The [device catalog](/devices) lists the registered JACDAC devices that can be automatically detected on the bus. Once a device is detected, the catalog information provides vendor information, pictures and firmware information.

## Service catalog

The [service catalog](/services) lists the registered JACDAC service classes, which are stored in the [JACDAC](https://github.com/microsoft/jacdac) repository.

## For JACDAC users

JACDAC has support for the C, CircuitPython, and TypeScript languages, as well as for Microsoft MakeCode.
To get familiar with the JACDAC abstractions and APIs right away, we suggest browsing the 
TypeScript [JACDAC Object Model](./clients/web/dom), which is used to make this web site a JACDAC endpoint (over WebUSB),
as well as the [tools](./tools/) built using the model.

## Applications

### Fashion

JACDAC was the technology used to network microcontrollers together at the 
[BKLYN Fashion Academy](https://www.bklynlibrary.org/bklyn-fashion-academy) in 2019.

## Why JACDAC?

The advent of simpler programming environments for microcontrollers over the past decade has greatly 
changed who can write code for them. It is now possible for novices to program microcontrollers using only a 
web browser, a process that was previously the domain of skilled embedded firmware engineers. 
However, despite a marked improvement in software tooling, it’s still challenging to build devices 
that bring together new combinations of hardware, as traditional protocols (such as I2C and SPI) 
for connecting microcontrollers to each other and to peripherals are low-level and inflexible. 

JACDAC is a new hardware/software stack for low-cost microcontrollers that makes connecting microcontrollers and peripherals 
as simple as plugging a USB device into your personal computer. JACDAC’s reversible physical connector, a flexible bus-based topology, 
standardized signalling and service specifications, hardware and software reference designs, and web-based tooling bring interactive 
device prototyping into the 21st century. 

The careful design of JACDAC means that it’s inexpensive and low power; it can be supported by 
microcontrollers that cost as little as two and a half US cents.  Support for WebUSB and TypeScript extends the JACDAC bus to the web 
browser (and the Internet), enabling the development of services and the debugging of the JACDAC bus directly from the Web browser, 
reducing the gap between the Web and the microcontroller.
