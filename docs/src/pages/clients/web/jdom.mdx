# JDOM

The JDOM module is a dependency-free JavaScript object model 
that reflects the state of the Jacdac elements:

- A **[bus](/clients/web/jdom/bus)** is made of connected devices.
- A **[device](/clients/web/jdom/device)** may host **services**.
- A **[service](/clients/web/jdom/service)** has **[registers](/clients/web/jdom/register)** and **[events](/clients/web/jdom/event)**, accepts **commands**,
and may return **acks**. 
- A **[register](/clients/web/jdom/register)** is an addressed data location, organized in [fields](/clients/web/jdom/field),
, that may be get, set or streamed. 

All the above elements are [nodes](/clients/web/jdom/node) in the [JDOM](/clients/web/jdom). All elements implement a event emitter and observable pattern to
easily data-bind them in a variety of UI frameworks.

## Setup

Install the ``jacdac-ts`` npm package (see full [setup instructions](/clients/web/setup)).

```
npm install --save jacdac-ts
```

## JavaScript/TypeScript ES6

If you are using JavaScript/TypeScript ES6, import all APIs 

```javascript
import { createUSBBus, CHANGE } from "jacdac-ts"

const bus = createUSBBus();
await bus.connectAsync();
bus.on(CHANGE, () => console.log(bus.devices()
    .map(device => device.toString())
    .join(", "))
    )
```

## Vanilla JavaScript

If you wish to use the library from a CDN or directly from a test web page, you can use the precompiled
``jacdac.umd.ts`` file. All exported symbols are imported into the ``jacdac`` name.

See [tools](/tools) for example of vanilla HTML/JavaScript pages using the library.
