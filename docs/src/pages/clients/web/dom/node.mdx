# JDNode

The base class of all elements in the [dom](/clients/web/dom).

> A JACDAC **[bus](/clients/web/dom/bus)** is made of connected devices.
A **[device](/clients/web/dom/device)** hosts **services**.
A **[service](/clients/web/dom/service)** has **registers**, accept **commands**
and may return **acks**. A **[register](/clients/web/dom/register)** is an addressed data location
on a service, that may be get, set or streamed. An **[event](/clients/web/dom/event)** is an address location that may receive event packets.
All these elements are [nodes](/clients/web/dom/node) in the [DOM](/clients/web/dom).

The node is globally uniquely identifiable in the dom,
implement an event emitter pattern is observable.

## Methods

### ``id``

The ``id`` identifier can be used to lookup any node within a single bus.

```javascript
const node = bus.node(id)
```

### ``on``

Registers a handler for a given event.

```javascript
import { CONNECT } from "jacdac"

node.on(CONNECT, () => console.log('connect!'))
```

### ``off``

Unregisters a handler for a given event. Noop if the handler is not registered.

```javascript
const handler = () => console.log('connect!')
node.off(CONNECT, handler)
```

### ``once``

Registers a handler to be run once and unregistered immediately.

```javascript
node.once(CONNECT, () => console.log('connect!'))
```

### ``observe``

Returns an **observable** stream for the given event. 

```javascript
const observer = node.observe(CONNECT)
observer.subscribe({
    next: () => console.log('connect!')
})
```

## ``subscribe``

This function subscribes to the event and returns a handler to unregister.
It is a small wrapper for the ``observe`` function.

```javascript
const unregister = node.subscribe(CONNECT, () => console.log('connect!'))
...
unregister()
```

If you are using React Hooks, use ``subscribe`` with ``useEffect`` to handle events.

```typescript
import { useEffect } from React
import { CHANGE } from "jacdac"

function MyComponent() {
    const node = ...
    useEffect(() => node.subscribe(CHANGE, () => {
        console.log('changed!')
        ... // do something stateful
    }))
    ...
}
```
