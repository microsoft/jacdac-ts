# JDBus

The **bus** is the top-level [DOM](/clients/web/dom) element.
It processes the incoming and outcoming packets, 
handles the connection to the underlying communiction transport
and maintains a set of active [devices](/clients/web/device) nodes.

## WebUSB bus

The most common use is to create a bus that uses WebUSB to
communicate to a physical JACDAC device. This is done with ``createUSBBus``.

```javascript
import { createUSBBus } from "jacdac"

const bus = createUSBBus();
```

## Connection and disconnection

By default, the WebUSB bus will try to reconnect 
to any known connected physical device. The JACDAC physical device hasn't been paired yet,
you can initiate the connection from a user interaction handler (security measure as the user must manually pick the device).

```javascript
await bus.connectAsync();
```

The bus will detect that the physical device is disconnected automatically. If you wish to disconnect manually, use

```javascript
await bus.disconnectAsync();
```

You can query the status of the connection using ``bus.connectionState``. The connection has 4 states:

* connected: connected to a physical device over WebUSB and receiving packets
* connection: connection in progress (for example, user is selecting the device)
* disconnected: no active connection to a physical device
* disconnecting: closing the connection to the physical device

Using the ``CONNECTION_STATE`` event, you can track changes of the state.

```javascript
import { CONNECTION_STATE } from "jacdac"

// am i in connected state?
const connected = bus.connected
bus.on(CONNECTION_STATE, state => console.log(state))
```

<Widget>
<ConnectButton />
</Widget>

## Devices

You can query the bus at any to receive a snapshot of the devices DOM.

```javascript
const devices = bus.devices()
for(const device of devices)
    console.log(device)
```

## Events

All bus state mutation are advertised by events. You can listen or subscribe to those events.
