# DOM

The DOM module is a depenency-free JavaScript object module 
that reflects the state of the JACDAC elements:

> A JACDAC **[bus](/clients/web/dom/bus)** is made of connected devices.
A **[device](/clients/web/dom/device)** hosts **services**.
A **[service](/clients/web/dom/service)** has **registers**, accept **commands**
and may return **acks**. A **[register](/clients/web/dom/register)** is an addressed data location
on a service, that may be get, set or streamed. All these elements are [nodes](/clients/web/dom/node) in the [DOM](/clients/web/dom).

All element implement a event emitter and observable pattern to
easily data-bind them in a variety of UI frameworks.

* [Bus](/clients/web/dom/bus)
* [Device](/clients/web/dom/device)
* [Service](/clients/web/dom/service)
* [Register](/clients/web/dom/register)
* [Node](/clients/web/dom/node)

## Setup

Install the ``jacdac-ts`` npm package (see full [setup instructions](/clients/web/setup)).

```
npm install --save jacdac-ts
```

## JacaScript/TypeScript ES6

If you are using JavaScript/TypeScript ES6, import all APIs 

```javascript
import { createUSBBus, CHANGE } from "jacdac"

const bus = createUSBBus();
await bus.connectAsync();
bus.on(CHANGE, () => bus.devices()
    .map(device => device.toString())
    .join(", "))
```

## Vanilla JavaScript

If you wish to use the library from a CDN or directly from a test web page, you can use the precompiled
``jacdac.umd.ts`` file. All exported symbols are imported into the ``jacdac`` name.

See [tools](/tools) for example of vanilla HTML/JavaScript pages using the library.
