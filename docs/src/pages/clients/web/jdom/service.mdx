# JDService

> A **service** is a [DOM](/clients/web/jdom) [node](/clients/web/jdom/node)
that has [registers](/clients/web/jdom/register), [events](/clients/web/jdom/event), accept **commands**
and may return **acks**. A service is hosted in a [device](/clients/web/jdom/device).

This object inherits methods and properties from [node](/clients/web/jdom/node).

## Methods

```

### ``event``

This function returns an [event](/clients/web/jdom/event) object mapped at a given address.
You can use an event to listen to events coming from the device.
