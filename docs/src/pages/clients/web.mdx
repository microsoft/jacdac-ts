# Web

JACDAC provides a modern JavaScript interface to interact with the bus.

* [Setup](/clients/web/setup)

The JACDAC libraries are separate in modules per dependencies:

## [DOM](/clients/web/dom)

This module contains the JACDAC DOM: Device, Service, Register, Packet. It has **no** dependencies.

## [GraphQL](/clients/web/graphql)

Mounts an in-browser GraphQL server that allows querying the state of the JACDAC via GraphQL queries. Implemented on top of [GraphQL-js](https://github.com/graphql/graphql-js)

## [React](/clients/web/react)

Hooks and helpers to integrate JACDAC components into React 16+.
