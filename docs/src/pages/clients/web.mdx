# Web Clients

You can embed this web site as IFrame in your web site and interact with JACDAC with post messages. This is a flexible option to integrate in any web site at low cost.

* [IFrame embed](/clients/web/iframe)

JACDAC provides a modern JavaScript interface to interact with the bus.
The JACDAC libraries are separate in modules per dependencies:

* [DOM](/clients/web/dom)

This dependency-free module contains the JACDAC DOM: Device, Service, Register, Packet.

* [React](/clients/web/react)

Hooks and helpers to integrate JACDAC components into React 16+.

* [GraphQL](/clients/web/graphql)

Mounts an in-browser GraphQL server that allows querying the state of the JACDAC via GraphQL queries. Implemented on top of [GraphQL-js](https://github.com/graphql/graphql-js)
